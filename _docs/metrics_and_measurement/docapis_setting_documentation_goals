Setting goals is usually part of any tech writer’s life in a corporation, where managers are trained to look for ways to measure and optimize performance. While goals often take on aspirational qualities, there’s also a standard fall-back goal that you can always go with: 100% doc coverage for each release. This is a kind of bare-bones-doing-your-basic-job goal, but it could complement some of the more aspirational goals. And in some ways, this bare-bones goal is a great goal. Here’s why:

* You can easily measure and track your progress against this goal.
* You’re already likely focused on this work, so it doesn’t feel like an extracurricular hobby.
* Getting plugged into the release process is essential to becoming an integrated, productive tech writer.

Also, many people don’t care a ton about docs and just want to check the documentation box for each release. Consequently, the lack of a more aspirational goal (e.g., rework the information architecture to drive satisfaction scores up by 200%) might not be a goal anyone deeply cares about. If that’s the case, focus on the bread-and-butter work you’re already doing &mdash; but do it better by following the tips below. You can also spice up this bare-bones goal by adding quality measures around it.

## Understanding your release process

The 100% doc coverage goal first forces you to get a good handle on your release process, which is central to thriving in any documentation role because it defines how you stay plugged in to other groups. Understanding your release process requires you to figure out the cadence of the software groups you support, and how software is developed and released. 

Each software development group tends to have their own process, so try to figure out the following:

* **Understand how to view the roadmap**. The roadmap allows you to anticipate what’s coming 6+ months down the line. Look for those big tickets that will require more than a few paragraphs of content. You want to avoid being ambushed one week before release with a last-minute request that puts you into crisis mode.
* **Understand the definition of done.** How do product teams qualify their feature for release? Surely QA must sign off on the feature, but is there a docs requirement prior to release as well? Look for ways to insert docs into the definition of done.
* **Understand dashboards and tracking mechanisms.** What sites, tools, or documents are used to track what’s planned for upcoming releases, and how do you adjust the toggles on these dashboards to look at the next few releases? Each company has its own tools for this (actually, each group within each company tends to have its own tools), and they aren’t always obvious to those outside of product management.

Already you can see that getting a strong handle on the release process will pay dividends in all areas of docs, beyond this simple goal.

## Checking for doc coverage 

When you see the release items surface on the horizon, look through each item included and assess whether you have doc coverage. For metrics, you can score your doc coverage against all items in the release. For example, suppose you have six new features being released in the next version. Can you indicate a changelist or other commit that covers each of the features being released?

Each time you reach out to a product manager (PM) to assess doc coverage, you reinforce the need for docs, teaching PMs about how the doc process works. This helps PMs understand your role and anticipate the need for docs in the future in advance. In short, you build visibility, rapport, and awareness of your role. This is partly why inserting yourself in the release process as a checkpoint, even if informally, helps your tech comm group become more integrated with product teams.

## What needs docs?

What items in the release actually need docs? Basically, if there’s a release, it means something changed. These changes usually need documentation. However, sometimes the changes are backend fixes and optimizations that don’t affect users. Maybe the dev team spent a month fixing technical debt with spaghetti code, and there’s no need to document anything (externally, anyway). If so, great, you can avoid doc coverage for that release item.

Another scenario might be bug fixes that don’t change any existing functionality. Release notes often include a list of bug fixes, and if the fixes simply address glitches in the code, you probably don’t need any docs for these.

But by and large, most items in the release should point to some page in the documentation. Release notes are meant to be short teasers for content that is elaborated upon in the pages of your documentation. For example, release notes for a feature might have a one paragraph summary with a link to a documentation page that expands in more detail. A good-looking release notes page will have a lot of paragraphs with “For more information, see ...” links.

## Expanding the doc coverage with a doc quality measure

Another consideration is how much doc coverage actually counts as coverage. What if a new feature only has a few inline comments in a code file. Does that count as documentation? In the scope of documentation, a feature might merit anything from a brief description to a full-fledged tutorial, sample app, walk-through code, extensive step-by-step tasks, and more. Can you consider a feature to have documentation coverage if the documentation released is poor and insufficient?

Here’s where you have some options. You could expand the doc coverage goal with an additional category of doc quality. For each feature covered by docs, you could score the documentation with a quality rating. As a tech writer, you typically know when docs are good or not. For example, did you personally test the docs, or just copy and paste content an engineer gave you in haste? Does the documentation describe the request and response in a complete way? Are the step-by-step tasks described with enough detail for users to make their way through the docs?

However, adding quality ratings to docs in each release isn’t something I’ve tried, and it might create more controversy than anything else, as it would force you to justify the decisions around the documentation. Also, this scoring will likely require you to define rubrics to justify the scores. No one wants to see a “C-” score for the docs related to their shiny new feature. Scoring doc quality is probably more than you want to tackle, but it would help spur some internal conversations with your doc team about potential improvements.

Some other doc quality measures might be much less controversial but still highly valuable. How about this one: Which of the features were personally tested by technical writers? While it might seem like a given that tech writers test all the features they document, that’s hardly the case. The setup and execution of the features often requires extensive engineering knowledge and expertise. If you’re working in dev docs, testing each feature is a feat unto itself. The extra effort doesn’t always pay dividends toward quality, so this might require a lot of time and setup at the expense of more writing; still, at heart I feel like testing the features we document as technical writers injects fun into the profession. I know my docs are much better when I can experience the feature first-hand rather than merely seeing screenshots or hearing the feature described by engineers.

## Conclusion

There are many goals one could set &mdash; I just explored one that seems to be somewhat common in doc groups. Common, but with rewarding results. If you have goals you’d like to share, please add them in the comments below.
