After completing the [API reference tutorial](docapis_api_reference_tutorial_overview.html), you're ready to start an activity that gives you more experience in creating and editing API reference documentation.

{% include random_ad4.html %}

In this activity, you'll evaluate some API reference topics to identify issues.


* TOC
{:toc}

{% include content/activities/evaluate_elements_api_ref.md %}

{% include random_ad1.html %}

{% include image_ad_right.html %}

## Next steps

Now that you understand the essential sections to cover in documenting API endpoints, let's look at standardized approaches for describing these sections, primarily with the [Overview of REST API specification formats](pubapis_rest_specification_formats.html).

{% include random_ad2.html %}

The OpenAPI standard will help make sure you cover all the necessary details in these sections, and it will present the information to users in a way that users have become accustomed to.
