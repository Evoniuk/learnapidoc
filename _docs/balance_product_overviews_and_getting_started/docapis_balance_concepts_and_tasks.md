Product overviews and getting started tutorials are among the first topics users consult as they get started with a product. Although other sections in this course explained best practices for [product overviews](docapis_doc_overview.html) and [getting started tutorials](docapis_doc_getting_started_section.html), this section explores reasons why these topics are often neglected, whether some of those reasons are valid, and strategies for overcoming these challenges.
