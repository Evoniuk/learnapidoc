Have you ever found yourself reading documentation on a developer portal and wondered, what exactly is the product? What does it do? Who is this for? Why isn't it more clear? I call this condition "product overview anemia." Here's how it potentially happens.

A product team works with partners on a feature. The conceptual basis for the feature is already understood by the partner, either because the product team worked with the partner's request, or because the product team iterated with the partner to develop the feature.

Once the feature is complete, some brief technical docs were added that explain how to use the feature. But the feature itself, the reason it was created, the problem it solves, the high-level overview and description of the feature, etc., is not documented because the initial partner didn't need that high-level. Soon, the documentation follows a similar trend elsewhere, and consequently you end up with lots of little building blocks and technical how-to's but no higher-level descriptions and glue between all of these tasks. New users who didn't participate in the feature's development have to try to derive back what the feature is and why/what/who, etc., it is for.

Product overview anemia is a byproduct of the agile development process itself. This is because agile development encourages team to develop products in close collaboration with users, frequently checking in to assess whether they're on track, making course corrections as needed from user feedback, and so on. Additionally, agile teams try to minimize they amount of documentation they create so that they can more easily pivot and course correct to align with user needs.

This is where a technical writer's perspective as an outsider becomes so important. If you're an outsider to both the product and domain, you won't have this co-development history and won't have seen the product evolve from a sketch on a napkin to a fully released product. You'll see the lack of connecting glue between topics, the absence of a larger story that connects with your needs, and more.
