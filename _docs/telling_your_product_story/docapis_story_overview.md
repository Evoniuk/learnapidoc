Ideas such as minimalism (as defined by John Carroll, Hans Van Der Meij, and others) and research about opportunistic learning behaviors encourage much more action-oriented approaches to tech writing. These action-oriented approaches might include getting started tutorials, interactive features like Swagger UI, code you can run directly in the browser (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks), task-focused how-to's, and more. For decades now, researchers have been reiterating the belief that users are "reading to do" and are anxious to get going with tasks and other hands-on exploration. Readers don't want lengthy explanations but rather specific steps to accomplish a task at hand.

At the same time, documentation often fails to tell the who/what/when/why about the product. Anemic overview pages provide little detail about what the product even is before jumping directly into how to configure it and install it. Countless project overview pages on GitHub give almost no indication about what the project code actually does, who it's for, its use cases, or other high-level details. Many of the problems with documentation involve the absence of a larger story around the product, a lack of connecting pieces that tie all the components together into a cohesive arc.

How do you balance this tension between action (with task-based docs) and narration (with concept-based docs)? When do you focus on reading to do versus reading to understand?

In general, best practices for documentation would mean accounting for both mindsets and orientations. For the reading-to-do mindset, you provide a getting started tutorial that gets the reader going in an immediate, hands-on way with the product. For the reading-to-understand mindset, you provide a product overview that tells the story of your product, answering high-level questions about the product, including the problem it solves, who the product is for, listing sample use cases, presenting architectural diagrams, development timelines, known limitations, and more. I

In previous topics, I already described [getting started tutorials](docapis_doc_getting_started_section.html) and [product overviews](docapis_doc_overview.html). In this section, I want to go deeper with the product overview to look at the larger story that you tell with a product. This larger story is often neglected in developer docs. When you have more than just standalone documentation, when you actually have a portal of many different documentation, the possibility of story presents itself more fully. As you tell the larger story, you might explain the developer's journey through your product, from beginning steps to final implementation. You might connect the dots between different products, taking a loose collection of jigsaw pieces and making them fit into a larger picture. You not only seek to explain why, but why it matters, addressing specific pain points and conflicts your users face.
